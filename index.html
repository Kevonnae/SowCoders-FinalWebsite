                <h2> By Kevonnae Kerr</h2>
                <p>Period Poverty is the lack of access to menstrual products due to finacial constraints.</p>
                <br>My social problem is Period Poverty in my community. 

                   <br> Period Poverty shows:
                   <br> Inequality in society.
                   <br> Dignity is lost.
                   <br> Girls miss school when they are on their period cycle.
                   <br> Unhygienic menstrual practices can lead to health issues.
                    
                 <br> Others should be aware of this social problem so that they will be aware of the negative impacts that period poverty has on teenage girls. Also others need to be aware of this social problem so that they can help with funding to provide these very important period products for women and teenage girls and to raise awareness of the social issue.</br>  
                    
                  <p>Mission Statement</p>
                    
                    My product will help to alleviate the stress that teenagers and women experience on a monthly basis because of lack of access to period products. This product helps teenage girls and women of low income families. This will help to provide pads, tampons, sanitary bins for teenage girls and women in my community and beyond. This will also prevent the use of unsafe materials such as rags and cloths that are being used as an alternative.This will make my community better because it will improve period dignity. Additionally, this social change product will make my community better by improving the educational levels of teenage girls because they will be more fully engaged in their education.

                   <p>About Me</p>  
                   <br> I am Kevonnae Kerr. I am from the country of Jamaica. I am currently a high school student. I love Marine life, the Sciences and Christmas. Period Poverty is a problem that women and teenagers face on a monthly basis so I want to help to stop Period Poverty. I am passionate about making a change about this problem because I don't like social injustice and I see period poverty as a form of social injustice. I want to ensure that teenage girls not just in my community but across Jamaica have equal access to period products.
